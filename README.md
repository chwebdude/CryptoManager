# CryptoManager
A Cryptocurrency Manager

This is a simple tool to import your crypto transactions and trades and show your profit and much more. It runns on your own computer. So you don't have to provide your credentials to any third party. Everything stays on your disk!
The tool itself is based on .Net Core. So it's plattform independent :blush:
